## MetaParsedown

MetaParsedown extends **erusev/parsedown**, a very nice markdown parser, by adding the ability to have metadata in markdown files in the form of valid yaml.  MetaParsedown uses the Symfony Yaml component to parse and extract the metadata.  I created this because we were creating a markdown document management system and needed a way to add metadata to each file.  The other option was a separate metadata file for each markdown file, which is fine, but seemed cumborsome for those creating the documents.  This way seemed easier and is pretty simple to use.

MetaParsedown retains all the functionality of **erusev/parsedown**, but adds two methods:

* **meta($markdown)** -- returns an array of the key/value metadata tags in the markdown

* **stripMeta($markdown)** returns bare markdown with yaml frontmatter stripped out

Parsedown's original **text($markdown)** method continues to return HTML, without the metadata tags

### Installation

Include `erusev/parsedown` original class `Parsedown.php`, and `MetaParsedown` or install [the composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/pagerange/metaparsedown).

### Adding meta data

Add metadata as valid yaml key/value pairs, delimited by three dashes at the start and end.  This yaml block must appear at the start of the document.  

```markdown
    
---
title: 'My Great Document'
author: 'Yours Truly'
description: 'A short document with very little to say'
status: 'public'
created_at: '2017-11-18 12:01:00'
---
# My Great Document

This is the rest of the markdown document

* bullet list item
* bullet list item

```

### Usage

``` php

$mp = new MetaParsedown(); 

echo $mp->text($markdown); // prints HTML, without meta data

$meta = $mp->meta($markdown); // returns an array of key/value pairs

$bare_markdown = $mp->stripMeta($markdown); // returns markdown without yaml block
  
```

See the [`erusev/parsedown` git page](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) for more information and detailed documentation on how to use it and how it works.
